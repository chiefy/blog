With the audio and video streaming wars of the early aught 2010s starting to come to a head with advent of diminishing profits, artist distrust and general malaise for the public, it might be time for you to create your own music streaming service for yourself and your loved ones.

Ever since the advent of Napster and music sharing in general, I have personally become obsessed with music of all sorts. Even before file sharing and the internet got more accessible for some of us, I spent my time making trips to the local public library to "borrow" CDs and DVDs. I am in no way advocating for piracy anywhere in this write-up, however for some recordings and films, it's the only way you will still be able to enjoy them unless you are lucky enough to have kept a physical copy of media that has long since been discontinued.

This is how I am currently running my whole-home audio setup. I have tried a bunch of software and configurations, but for me this is what has been working very, very well for the past year or so.

Caveats:

I have been into tech and computers for a long time. I have spent the past 20+ years working professionally as a (crappy) tech lackey. I enjoy tinkering with my home setup and problem solving etc. Home servers and audio setups are definitely *not* for everyone. If you are the type of person who gets frustrated when their Roku isn't playing something correctly, this setup might not be for you.
