With the audio and video streaming wars of the early aught 2010s starting to come to a head with advent of diminishing profits, artist distrust and general malaise for the public, it might be time for you to create your own music streaming service for yourself and your loved ones.

Ever since the advent of Napster and music sharing in general, I have personally become obsessed with music of all sorts. Even before file sharing and the internet got more accessible for some of us, I spent my time making trips to the local public library to "borrow" CDs and DVDs. I am in no way advocating for piracy anywhere in this write-up, however for some recordings and films, it's the only way you will still be able to enjoy them unless you are lucky enough to have kept a physical copy of media that has long since been discontinued.

This is how I am currently running my whole-home audio setup. I have tried a bunch of software and configurations, but for me this is what has been working very, very well for the past year or so.

Caveats:

I have been into tech and computers for a long time. I have spent the past 20+ years working professionally as a (crappy) tech lackey. I enjoy tinkering with my home setup and problem solving etc. Home servers and audio setups are definitely *not* for everyone. If you are the type of person who gets frustrated when their Roku isn't playing something correctly, this setup might not be for you.

Hardware:

Generally speaking listening to and transcoding audio files is a pretty *easy* task for most modern computing hardware (unlike video). To get started you'll need the following:

* two computers - these could be Raspberry Pi's, NUCs, old desktops you have laying around etc. Really the only limitation is that they run a modern OS (MacOS, Windows or Linux)
* storage - depending on how large your library is, you will need somewhere to store all that music. I have a NAS, but any storage space with decently fast I/O will work fine.
* amplification/speakers - the internet is rife with debate, discussion and downright flame wars on what kind of amps and speakers *you* should get. I won't cover any of that here, only say that you will need a set of powered speakers, or passive speakers and amp for each seat, or station you want in your home
* DAC (optional) - there is a lot of debate about DAC (digital to analog convertors) on the internet, but the bottom line is that you should use one if you at all care about getting the best out of this setup, and it doesn't have to be super expensive.
